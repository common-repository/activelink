Quickly set links to wikipedia definitions of words/phrases by using a wikipedia-style syntax.

== Description ==

ActiveLink allows you to set links to wikipedia articles by means of a wikipedia-style syntax when typing your posts. 

*Write "{en:Post}" to create a link to the english lemma of "Post".
*Write "{de:Post}office" to get a link to the german definition of "Post", but let the link title display "Postoffice".
*Write "{en:Blog|Wordpress}" to create a link to the english definition of "Blog", but have the link display "Wordpress" instead.

This plugin will be extended to also provide quick links to other services (like google search, technorati etc.) in the future.
